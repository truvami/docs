#### 1. Charge the Truvami® smart label
The smart label uses the ambient indoor light as an energy source. The optimal exposure is around 1000 lux and a full charge can take up to 2 days. 

:warning: **Warning:** Exposing the label to direct sunlight of high intensity is not advised as the organic photovoltaic cells of the smart label are not designed for these conditions.


#### 2. Short press on the power button activates the tracker
After pressing the power button and releasing it, the LED will blink 5 times in green. After a few seconds, the LED will blink again 3 times in green to indicate a successful join to the network.

```
If the tracker cannot join the network, the LED will blink in red. 
It will try automatically to join the network until being successful. 
```


#### 3. Click on the activation link that you have received by email

It will take you to the https://dashboard.truvami.com page where you can set your
password.

## Troubleshooting

In the event that the device fails to join, consider the following list of workarounds:

#### 1. Check your LoRaWAN coverage.
If applicable, plug in your LoRaWAN Gateway. In case you have your own network server, check on there if data is coming through.

#### 2. Check if battery is fully charged: 
Leave the smart label exposed to constant indoor lighting for one day and try step 2 again.

#### 3. Reset the Smart Label

To reset your Truvami Smart Label, you will need to switch it off and then switch it on again.

##### Steps
###### Switch Off

- Press and hold the power button firmly for 10 seconds.

- Release the button – the device will power down.

###### Switch On

- Press the power button firmly for 1 second..

- The device will restart and is now reset.
