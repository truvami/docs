# Events

The **Events** page provides a chronological list of device-related events generated within the system.  
Events help users monitor device behavior, identify issues, and understand operational patterns across their deployment.

Each event entry includes essential metadata, such as timestamp, event type, device identifier, device type,  
a descriptive message, and a link to the associated uplink.

## Events Table Overview

The table on this page displays a list of all recorded events within the selected time range.  
Each row includes the following fields:

- **Timestamp** – when the event occurred  
- **Event Type** – the event category (e.g., Duty Cycle, Motion, Geofence Entry/Exit)  
- **DevEUI** – unique device identifier  
- **Device Type** – model or tracker family (e.g., Tag S)  
- **Description** – a human-readable explanation of the event  
- **Uplink** – a link to the dedicated Dashboard page for that particular uplink message

Pagination controls appear at the bottom when multiple pages of events are available.

## Date Range Selector

In the upper-right corner, users can filter events by selecting a specific **date and time range**.

Clicking the date field opens a calendar view that includes:

- day selection  
- month navigation  
- start time selector  
- end time selector  

This allows precise filtering down to the minute.

## Quick Range Presets

Next to the date range field, a dropdown provides predefined time intervals:

- **Today**  
- **Yesterday**  
- **Last week**  
- **Last month**  
- **Last 3 months**

Selecting a preset automatically reloads events for the chosen interval.

## Column Visibility Options

The column visibility menu allows users to add or remove specific columns in the Events table.

Available columns include:

- **Event Type**  
- **DevEUI**  
- **Device Type**  
- **Description**  
- **Uplink**

Users can toggle individual columns on or off as needed.

## Pagination

If the number of events exceeds the page limit, navigation controls appear at the bottom:

- **Previous**  
- **Next**  

These allow users to move between pages of events.
