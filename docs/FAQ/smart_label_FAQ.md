## 5.  Activation & Connectivity

### How do I activate the device?
- 🔘 Short press the power button.  
- 🟢 LED blinks **5x green** → starting.  
- 🟢 LED blinks **3x green** → successfully joined network.  
- 🔴 LED blinks **red** → connection failed (device retries automatically).  

###  I pressed the button but I don’t see any LED light. What does it mean?
This can mean two things:  
1. The device is already activated.  
2. The device needs to harvest more energy.  

👉 Please check the **Truvami Dashboard** for messages.  
☀️ If nothing appears, place the label under good indoor lighting for up to **two days** to recharge.  

###  How do I check LoRaWAN connection?
-  Confirm your LoRaWAN Network Server (e.g., Swisscom, TTI) is configured.  
-  Check for messages in the **Truvami Dashboard**.  
-  If no signal, test with a LoRaWAN coverage tester and add a gateway if needed.
