# Groups

The **Groups** page allows users to organize trackers into logical collections.  
Groups help segment devices based on teams, locations, projects, or operational categories.  
This enables easier filtering, improved visibility, and more efficient management of large deployments.

<br></br>

## Groups Table Overview

The main table lists all existing groups. Each entry includes:

- **Group name**  
- **Group color** (visual identifier)  
- **Description** (if enabled)  
- **Created at** timestamp  

Groups that contain no trackers are displayed as **Empty Group**.

Pagination controls at the bottom allow navigation when many groups are present.

## Search Bar

The search bar at the top of the page allows filtering groups by their:

- name  
- description  

Search results update in real time.

## Creating a Group

Clicking the **Create new** button opens a modal window that allows creating a new group.

### Fields in the Create Group Popup

#### **Name**
A required text field for the group name.

#### **Group color**
A color selector that defines the visual marker for this group across the dashboard  
(e.g., on the map or in tracker lists).

#### **Description**
Optional field (up to 1000 characters) for adding additional context about the group.

#### **Assign Trackers**
A list of available trackers is displayed on the right.  
Users can:

- browse the list  
- search trackers by name or DevEUI  
- select one or multiple trackers to add to the group

After filling out the details, clicking **Create** adds the new group to the list.

A **Cancel** button closes the popup without saving changes.

## Column Visibility Options

Users can customize the table by enabling or disabling specific columns.

Available columns:

- **Description**  
- **Created at**

The column selection menu can be accessed by clicking the table layout icon in the top-right corner of the page.

## Pagination

For deployments with many groups, pagination controls at the bottom allow users to move forward or backward between pages.
