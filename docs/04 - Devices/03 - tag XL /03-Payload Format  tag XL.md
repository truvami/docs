## Uplinks

### Settings Uplink

A settings uplink is sent on port 151.
The payload uses the TLV format (tag Length Value).
It is defined as: 

| tag  | Length                    | Number of Commands           | Data                   |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| 0x4C | Variable number (uint8_t) | Variable number (uint8_t)    | Commands in TLV format |

The settings uplink contains one or more settings in its data section.
These settings are again in TLV format and are either device or runner settings:

|  # | Device Setting                   | tag  | Size | Data                                                                                                                     | Format      |

### GNSS-NG Localization Message

GNSS-NG localization messages are sent on port 192.
These messages are sent after a successful GNSS scan and they are generated by Semtech's geolocation service.
The device decides by itself whether it starts an autonomous GNSS scan or an assisted GNSS scan.
Before the device is able to perform an assisted GNSS scan, it must have a valid assistance position.

The device obtains an assistance position by performing an autonomous GNSS scan.
Afterwards, it locally demodulates time and computes an assistance position.
After an autonomous GNSS scan, the device sends a single GNSS-NG message.
As soon as the device has a valid assistance position, it performs assisted GNSS scans whenever possible.
The device is configured in MOBILE mode, which means it performs 2 GNSS scans with no delay between them.
After an assisted GNSS scan, the device sends either one or two GNSS-NG messages, depending on whether one or both scans were successful.
If a GNSS scan fails, the device does not send any GNSS-NG messages and starts a Wi-Fi scan instead.

The GNSS-NG messages are forwarded the LoRaCloud solver which computes the final position.
The multiframe feature of the LoRaCloud solver is used to combine the results of the two GNSS scans into a single position if two GNSS-NG messages are sent after an assisted GNSS scan.

Please refer to the section
[GNSS scan & send services](https://github.com/Lora-net/SWL2001/blob/v4.5.0/lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/geolocation_services/README.md#2-gnss-scan--send-services)
of the README of Semtech's geolocation services for more information.
A detailed description of the LoRa Edge GNSS-NG (NAV-Group) positioning protocol is available
[here](https://www.loracloud.com/documentation/modem_services?url=mdmsvc.html#modem-service-protocol-payloads).

### Wi-Fi Localization Message

A Wi-Fi localization message is sent on port 197.
This message is sent after a successful Wi-Fi scan and it is generated by the Semtech's geolocation service.
The scan simply returns the list of access point MAC addresses that have been detected and sends it to the LoRaCloud solver within one uplink message.

Whenever a location scan is triggered, the device first performs a GNSS scan.
If the GNSS scan is successful, the device sends one or two GNSS-NG messages.
If the GNSS scan is not successful, the device performs a Wi-Fi scan.

Please refer to the section
[Wi-Fi scan & send services](https://github.com/Lora-net/SWL2001/blob/v4.5.0/lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/geolocation_services/README.md#4-wi-fi-scan--send-services)
of the README of Semtech's geolocation services for more information.

[here](https://www.loracloud.com/documentation/modem_services?url=mdmsvc.html#modem-service-protocol-payloads).

### Message Usage

#### Welcome Messages

A welcome message is sent every time the device successfully joined to a LoRaWAN network.
It corresponds to a settings uplink for the tags `[0x40, 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44, 0x45, 0x46, 0x49, 0x4A]`.
Therefore, it contains all settings of the device in addition to the battery voltage, the firmware hash, the reset count and the reset cause.

#### Heartbeat Messages

A heartbeat message is sent at a fixed interval.
The HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL is stored in the settings.
A heartbeat message corresponds to a settings uplink for the tags `[0x45, 0x4B]`.
Therefore, it contains the battery voltage and the scan counts.
If the HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL is adjusted via a settings downlink, a heartbeat message is sent after a short delay and the new interval is used for the next heartbeat message.

#### Settings Messages

For every received setting downlink, the device takes the actions for the received commands and sends a settings uplink.
The actions are summarized in the following list:

- Setter command: Is used to change the value of a setting. First, the range of the value is checked. If the value is in the valid range, it is stored in NVM. The current value of the setting is added to the settings uplink.
- Getter command: Is used to read the value of a setting. The current value of the setting is added to the settings uplink.
- Runner command: Is used to execute an action with the given runner settings. Some runner commands trigger a settings uplink.

The settings uplink uses the same order of settings as the commands of the downlink that it received before.
For example, if the received downlink contains the commands with tags `[0x22, 0x20, 0x44, 0x80]`, the uplink will contain the settings with tags `[0x42, 0x40, 0x44, 0x80]`.
The value of the settings correspond to the value of the **applied** settings.
If one of the commands in the downlink tried to set a setting to a value out of range, the corresponding setting will not be changed.
Hence, the settings uplink will contain the last value that was applied successfully instead of the value that was requested by the downlink.

#### Settings Messages with Alarm Command

If a setting downlink contains the alarm runner command `0x80` an alarm with the specified duration and interval is started.
The parameters are stored in RAM, not in NVM. The device exits the alarm mode after the specified duration has elapsed.
A running alarm is stopped if an alarm downlink is received with either duration or interval set to 0 (or both).
As for other settings downlinks, the device sends a settings uplink after a downlink with an alarm runner command.
The uplink confirms the duration and interval that were used to start or stop the alarm.

## Downlinks

### Settings Downlink

A settings downlink is sent on port 151.
The payload uses the TLV format (tag Length Value).
It is defined as: 

| tag  | Length                    | Number of Commands           | Data                   |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| 0x4C | Variable number (uint8_t) | Variable number (uint8_t)    | Commands in TLV format |

The settings downlink contains one or more commands in its data section.
These commands are again in TLV format and are either setter, getter or runner commands:

| # | Setter Command                   | tag  | Size | Data                                                                                                                     | Format      |
