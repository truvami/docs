# Maintenance Guide - Truvami tag XL

## 1. Operating Conditions

### 1.1 Environmental Conditions
The truvami tag XL is designed for reliable operation in harsh industrial environments when used within the specified operating limits.

- **Operating temperature:** –20 °C to +60 °C  
- **Relative humidity:** 0 – 95 % RH, non-condensing  
- **Ingress protection:** IP67  

Operating the device outside these limits may reduce performance, battery lifetime, or device integrity.

---

### 1.2 Installation Environment
The device is suitable for both indoor and outdoor installations.

To ensure long-term reliability:
- Avoid continuous exposure to corrosive chemicals or atmospheres  
- Avoid permanent exposure to saltwater or marine environments  
- Avoid installations where standing water can accumulate on the mounting surface  

Before installation, ensure the mounting surface is clean, dry, and free of rust or debris.

---

### 1.3 Mechanical Mounting Conditions
The truvami tag XL is typically mounted using integrated screw-on magnets.

Recommended mounting surface characteristics:
- Flat and even
- Ferromagnetic
- Structurally stable

:::warning
Corroded or uneven mounting surfaces may reduce magnetic holding force and accelerate corrosion of mounting components.

### 1.4 Maintenance Triggers and Inspections

As part of regular maintenance, the following conditions should be monitored:

- Visual inspection every 2 months is recommended
- If the reported battery level drops below **20 %**, battery replacement is recommended (see Chapter 2 below)  
- If any rust or corrosion is observed on mounting magnets or screws, the affected components must be replaced (see Chapter 3 below)  
- Periodically verify that the device remains securely attached to the mounting surface, especially in high-vibration environments  
- Inspect the device housing for visible damage that may affect enclosure integrity  

Regular inspections help ensure continued safe and reliable operation of the device.

## 2. Battery Replacement

### 2.1 Recommended Battery Type
The truvami tag XL is powered by lithium primary batteries.

- **Battery type:** 2 × AA lithium primary cells  
- **Recommended model:** Energizer L91  

---

### 2.2 When to Replace the Battery
Battery replacement is required when one or more of the following conditions are met:

- The reported battery level drops below **20 %**
- A low battery status is reported by the system  

---

### 2.3 Battery Replacement Procedure
To replace the batteries, proceed as follows:

1. Remove the device from the mounting surface  
2. Using an appropriate screwdriver, loosen and remove all enclosure screws  
3. Carefully lift and remove the enclosure cover  
4. Remove both depleted batteries  
5. Insert **two new Energizer L91 AA lithium batteries**, observing correct polarity  
6. Ensure all seals and gaskets are correctly positioned  
7. Close the enclosure securely to maintain IP67 protection  (please check the details below)
8. Reattach the device to its original mounting surface  

:::warning
Improper sealing of the enclosure may compromise ingress protection.

#### Enclosure Closing and Torque Recommendation

The tag XL device uses the **353113 enclosure**, which incorporates **#6-32 threaded metal inserts** that are **overmolded into the plastic housing** (not heat-staked). These fasteners are used to secure the enclosure cover and to **compress the sealing O-ring**, ensuring environmental protection.

The enclosure is sealed using an **elastomer O-ring with a hardness of Shore-A 70**. Proper tightening of the enclosure screws is required to achieve sufficient O-ring compression while avoiding damage to the threaded inserts, enclosure housing, or sealing elements.

**Recommended tightening torque (starting point):**
- **2.5 – 3.5 in-lbs (0.28 – 0.40 Nm)**

Applying excessive torque may result in insert rotation, damage to the plastic housing, or degradation of the O-ring sealing performance. Insufficient torque may lead to inadequate sealing.

It is recommended to use a calibrated torque driver and to tighten enclosure screws evenly to ensure consistent compression of the O-ring.

### 2.4 Battery Handling and Disposal
- Do not recharge lithium primary batteries  
- Do not short-circuit or expose batteries to heat or fire  
- Dispose of used batteries in accordance with local environmental regulations

## 3. Magnet and Screw Inspection (Corrosion Prevention)

### 3.1 Inspection Interval
Regular inspection of mounting components is required to prevent corrosion-related issues.

- A **visual inspection every 2 months** is recommended  
- In corrosive or harsh environments, more frequent inspections may be required

---

### 3.2 Components to Inspect
During inspection, check the following components:

- Mounting magnets  
- Magnet screws  
- Contact surface between the magnet and the mounting surface  

---

### 3.3 Signs of Corrosion
Inspect all components for the following signs:

- Visible rust  
- Discoloration  
- Surface pitting  
- Reduced magnetic holding force  

---

### 3.4 Corrective Actions
If corrosion is detected, take the following actions:

- **If any magnet shows signs of rust, please replace the magnet immediately**
- **If any screw shows signs of rust, please replace the screw immediately**

Corroded components must not be reused, as this may lead to:
- Reduced holding force  
- Device detachment  
- Compromised enclosure integrity
